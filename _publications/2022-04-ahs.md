*Description:* Between July 2010 and May 2013, the Government of India conducted the Annual Health Survey in the eight Empowered Action Group states of north India and Assam. The purpose of the survey was to study the impact of reforms to maternal and child health services in the nine high-fertility, high-mortality states that comprise the EAG. 

The Annual Health Survey consists of a three-round panel that interviewed over 4 million households in each round, as well as a one-time Clinical, Anthropometric, and Bio-Chemical Survey. These data were released to the public in 2015 as a set of .csv files. Between December of 2019 and May of 2021, a team of researchers from The University of Texas at Austin assembled the publicly available microdata, constructed the necessary identifiers, cleaned the data, and released user-friendly versions of the constituent datasets on the University of Michiganâ€™s Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research.
