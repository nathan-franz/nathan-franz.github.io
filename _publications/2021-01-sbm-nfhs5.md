Abstract: How much did rural sanitation in India change under the five years of the Swacch Bharat Mission? The best nationally representative statistics on sanitation in India have long come from  the  Demographic  and  Health  Surveys,  known  as  the  National  Family  and  Health  Surveys  in  India.  The  fifth  round,  conducted  in  2019  and  2020,  was  interrupted  by  the  pandemic,  but  limited  summary  statistics  have  been  released  for  some  states.  Here  we  analyze  these  statistics.  We  conclude  that  about  half  of  the  rural  population  in  the  four  large  Indian  states  of  Bihar,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Rajasthan,  and  Uttar  Pradesh  continued  to  defecate in the open at the end of the Swacch Bharat Mission.
