excerpt: 'A large-scale sanitation program in India made open defecation more salient as a social issue. This paper documents how the relationship between children''s heights and open defecation weakened after the program, consistent with it worsening response bias. The estimate of the true prevalence of open defecation from our econometric model is much higher than survey estimates.'

*Abstract:* When assessing policy impact, how can one distinguish between genuine behavior change and reporting bias? We study this question in the context of a large-scale sanitation program in India. The association between child height and open defecation is attenuated after the sanitation program compared to before, which is consistent with greater under-reporting of open defecation after the program. Using a biased response model, our results imply that about half of rural Indian households still defecate in the open, versus 27 percent who self-report doing so. If so, widespread open defecation in rural India continues to harm childrenâ€™s health and survival.
